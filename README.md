# Milan Nodes for ComfyUI

This set of custom nodes for ComfyUI enhances image handling capabilities by adding loading with metadata extraction.

## Nodes

### 1. Load Image with Name, Title, Description

This node functions similarly to the standard `Load Image` node in ComfyUI, displaying a preview of the loaded image, but additionally provides the following information:

*   **Outputs:**
    *   `IMAGE`: The loaded image.
    *   `STRING` (File Name): The filename of the image.
    *   `STRING` (Title): The title of the image (if available).
    *   `STRING` (Description): The description of the image (if available).


### 2. Load Multiple Images with Name, Directory, Title, Description

This node sequentially loads images from the specified folder (the quantity is entered by the user to the right of the `▶️ Queue` button).

*   **Inputs:**
    *   `DIRECTORY_PATH`: Path to the folder containing images.

*   **Outputs (for each image):**
    *   `IMAGE`: The currently loaded image.
    *   `STRING` (File Name): The filename of the current image.
    *   `STRING` (Directory): The path to the directory from which the image was loaded.
    *   `STRING` (Title): The title of the current image (if available).
    *   `STRING` (Description): The description of the current image (if available).

*   **Features:**
    *   Images are loaded sequentially with each processing queue run.
    *   *More details about the batch loading mechanism and quantity control can be found [here](https://t.me/milandsgn/194). (in Russian language)*
